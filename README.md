# Mecha Jam! 

That's when you take the most powerful game engine and make it look like it's 1980.
This project was a submission to MechJam IV game jam. 
I wanted to explore pixelated stylized rendering and I am actually quite happy with the result.
Pretty much everything is written in C++, which is quite new to me, but a good step forward.

You can play the game here: https://fansi.itch.io/mechajam

Enjoy!
